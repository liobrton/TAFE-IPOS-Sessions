What you know you can't explain, but you feel it
Take the red or the blue pill
Neo is the one
Red or blue, it's your choice
Follow the white rabbit
There is no spoon
Welcome to the real world
Free your mind
The Matrix has you
Do not try and bend the spoon
Why oh why didn't I take the blue pill
I know kung fu
Ignorance is bliss
Human beings are a disease
Have you ever had a dream, Neo
This is your last chance
The Matrix is everywhere
There's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path
What you know you can't explain, but you feel it
